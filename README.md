In this contract we will learn how to mint/burn tokens from a wallet and also learn the functioning of the contract.

## DESCIRPTION
In this Contract their are 3 variables named as tokenname,tokenabbvr,total supply and we also have a mapping variable then after these all we have to functions which are mint function and burn function.
By Mint function we can add token in wallet.

These functions enable the contract owner to create new tokens (mint) and destroy existing tokens (burn) for specific addresses in the system.
